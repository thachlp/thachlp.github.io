Last week, I encountered a scenario that perfectly illustrates the quirks of working with `NULL` values in MySQL. I thought it might be beneficial to share my experience, as it could save someone else a bit of head-scratching.

We maintain two separate database instancesâ€”let's call them `instance1` and `instance2`. `Instance2` was originally cloned from `instance1`, but since they power different web pages, their data has diverged over time.

During a routine check on our testing system, I ran the following queries to get a user count from each instance:

```sql
-- Query 1:
SELECT COUNT(*) FROM instance1.usr_users; -- Result: 152,563

-- Query 2:
SELECT COUNT(*) FROM instance2.usr_users; -- Result: 163,264
```

Curious about the overlap of users between the two systems, I executed another query:

```sql
-- Query 3:
SELECT COUNT(*) FROM instance1.usr_users WHERE email IN (SELECT email FROM instance2.usr_users); -- Result: 142,546
```

Next, I wanted to find out how many users from `instance1` did **not** exist in `instance2`. This is where things got interesting:

```sql
-- Query 4:
SELECT COUNT(*) FROM instance1.usr_users WHERE email NOT IN (SELECT email FROM instance2.usr_users); -- Result: 0
```

This result was puzzling because, logically, there should have been some users unique to `instance1`. After some investigation, I realized that the presence of `NULL` values in the `email` column of `instance2` was causing the `NOT IN` subquery to produce unexpected results. In SQL, `NULL` represents an unknown value, and any comparison with `NULL` yields `NULL`, which is considered as false in the context of a `WHERE` clause.

To address this issue, I modified the subquery to exclude `NULL` values:

```sql
-- Query 5:
SELECT COUNT(*) FROM instance1.usr_users WHERE email NOT IN (SELECT email FROM instance2.usr_users WHERE email IS NOT NULL);
```

With this correction, the query returned the expected count of users that were unique to `instance1`.

This experience was a reminder of how important it is to be mindful of `NULL` values in SQL queries. For those looking to deepen their understanding of working with `NULL` in MySQL, I recommend checking out the official MySQL documentation: [Working with NULL Values](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/working-with-null.html).

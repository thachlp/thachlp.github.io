Although **SQL** and **Elasticsearch** have different terms for the way the data is organized (and different semantics), these analogies can help those with a relational database background understand Elasticsearch. However, it's important to recognize that these analogies are not perfect, as there are fundamental differences in how each system stores and manages data.
## Terminologies and data types

| SQL                               | Elasticsearch                           | Description                                                                                                                                                                              |
|-----------------------------------|-----------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| database                          | index                                   | In Elasticsearch, an index is a collection of documents and serves a role similar to a database in SQL.                                                                                 |
| table                             | index                                   | In Elasticsearch, an index also serves a role similar to a table in SQL, as it stores documents (akin to rows) with fields (akin to columns).                                           |
| row                               | document                                | A document in Elasticsearch is a JSON object and is similar to a row in an SQL table.                                                                                                    |
| column                            | field                                   | A field in Elasticsearch corresponds to a column in an SQL table and contains data for a specific attribute of a document.                                                               |
| INSERT INTO tbl_name VALUES ();   | POST \<index>/_doc/ or PUT \<index>/_doc/\<id> | In MySQL, you insert rows into a table using SQL. In Elasticsearch, you index documents using RESTful APIs, with POST (when ID is auto-generated) or PUT (when specifying an ID).        |
| SELECT                            | GET                                     | In SQL, SELECT is used to retrieve rows from a table. In Elasticsearch, GET is used to retrieve documents from an index.                                                                |
| AND                               | must                                    | In Elasticsearch Query DSL, the 'must' clause functions like the logical AND in SQL.                                                                                                     |
| OR                                | should                                  | In Elasticsearch Query DSL, the 'should' clause functions like the logical OR in SQL.                                                                                                    |

| VARCHAR                           | keyword                                 | In Elasticsearch, 'keyword' is used for structured content such as IDs, email addresses, hostnames, status codes, zip codes, etc. Keyword fields are not analyzed for full-text search.  |
| VARCHAR                           | text                                    | In Elasticsearch, 'text' is used for full-text content such as the body of an email or a product description. 'Text' fields are analyzed for full-text search.                           |

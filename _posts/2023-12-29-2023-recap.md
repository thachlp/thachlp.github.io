Today is the last working day of 2023, and it's time to look back at what I have accomplished this year:

#### Work
- Continued working at Line VN as a Software Engineer.
- Applied ChatGPT at work.
- Made some minor contributions to open-source projects: [Central Dogma](https://github.com/line/centraldogma), [Mockito](https://github.com/mockito/mockito), and [Spring](https://github.com/spring-projects).

#### Learn
- Completed several courses on [Redis University](https://university.redis.com/), including [Redis for Java Developers](https://university.redis.com/courses/ru102j) and [Redis Streams](https://university.redis.com/courses/ru202).
- Became a beginner at MongoDB and Elasticsearch.
- Wrote some technical blogs at [my GitHub Pages site](https://thachlp.github.io/).
- Re-read "Designing Data-Intensive Applications."
- Kept up with Duolingo and Cambly to improve my English.

#### Family
- Learned to become a father, spending most of my free time playing with my son.
- Took some family trips to Hanoi, Binh Dinh (hometown), Ha Long, and Dong Nai.

#### Hobbies
- Tried riding, but stopped for now.
- Attempted playing chess, but also stopped.

Overall, it has been challenging to maintain a balance between family, personal life, and work, but everything is good now. Looking forward to even better things in 2024!
